            <h3>Professinal Full Stack Developer</h3>
            <p>Nishat Hasan Muktar asked people for recommendations on what they thought were some of the most timeless articles about web development that have changed their perspective in some way. Fun! Iâ€™m gonna scour the thread and link up my favorites (that are actually articles, although not all of them are super directly related to web dev).</p>
